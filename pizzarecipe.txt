make pizza dough by using all purpose fluor, warm water, yiest, sugar and salt ingredientsa
after some time, pizza dough will furmeted and make pizza shape from it 
put on pizza pan and lap pizza souace on it and then chees and then any topings you want but my fav is jalapinoz, hot paper
and olives and green paper and push some oreganoz and baked it until it cooked


its really easy and you should try it at home 
home is always good and healthy rather than from parlour 
so please try it 
I never buy from parlour always making at home
thank you
