Ingredients
1 1/2 cups water
1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons honey
4 1/2 cups flour
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon yeast

Sauce
Toppings

Instructions

A preheated oven is key to a great crust. Up to an hour before baking, 
set your oven to 475 &deg. Bake pizzas for 8-15 minutes, depending on their size. 
Use the shorter baking time for smaller pizzas, the longer time for larger ones. 
Pay close attention to how your oven operates and how brown your pizzas are getting
